## Getting images from new decs

To get images for decks, these are the steps, always choosing the old frame when possible:

1. get the deck name
2. search for the deck list in the mtg goldfish pauper deck metagame
3. Get the card that gives the deck its name. If it is not clear, ask me.
4. For the card name, visit the scryfall and get the card image url
5. save the card image with deck name, just like the existing ones.
6. update the code to use it, just like we've been doing for the others.
